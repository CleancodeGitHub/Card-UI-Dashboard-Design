The Card UI Dashboard Design project involves creating a modern, dark-themed dashboard using HTML, CSS (SCSS), and SVG icons. It features a card-based layout that displays different projects with vibrant color highlights and progress tracking. Key elements include:

**Card Components:**
- Each card shows the project type, purpose, progress status, countdown timer, and team members' profile pictures.
- Cards are color-coded based on project type (green, orange, red, blue).

**Progress Bars:**
- Dynamic width bars show completion status (e.g., green card: 90%, orange card: 30%).

**Icons & Buttons:**
- SVG icons for visual elements.
- "Add" button to add team members.
- Countdown button shows remaining project days and changes color on hover.

**Modern Styling:**
- Dark background with contrasting card elements.
- Radial and linear gradients for a sleek look.
- Box shadows and border radius for a 3D effect.

**Responsive Design:**
- Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptability across screen sizes.

**Color Palette (SCSS Variables):**
- Blue: #1890ff
- Green: #01c3a8
- Orange: #ffb741
- Red: #a63d2a

This design aims to provide a visually appealing and functional dashboard for project management.
